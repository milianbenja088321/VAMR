Game Overview: This is a networked AR and VR experience. The theme of the game is a water balloon fight. In the base game, players will compete to splash each other with balloons which will eventually be hooked up to a mister. This project is going to showcase many of our company’s strengths in one cohesive experience. 
VR Side: The VR player will be shrunken down and surrounded by the AR players at the table. The goal of the VR player is to avoid, or deflect, the water balloons thrown at them.
AR Side: The AR players will work together to splash the VR player, and also risk being splashed by the VR player.
